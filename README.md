This repo, provides a simple line simplification demo using the simplify function in turf.js. By downloading all files,
index.html will generate a site with a map and allow them to draw a polyline on the map. Two buttons in the top left corner are 
provided to simplify the users polyline and clear that polyline to draw a new one. With that said, the mapping library used 
for the site is leaflet.
